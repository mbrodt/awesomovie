# Awesomovie

### Awesomovie is React application for browsing your favourite movies. It features search by titles and categories, watchlist to store movies for later watching, and a bunch of interesting data about the selected movie.

Live demo: http://priceless-austin-5c9f85.netlify.com/

To run the project locally, clone it to your machine and do `npm install` and then `npm start`

## Potential improvements

* Allow the user to fetch more movies at the bottom of a page (right now it only fetches the first 20)
* Add placeholder image for when a movie doesn't have a poster
* Add cast members for each movie
